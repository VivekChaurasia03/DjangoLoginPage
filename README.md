# DjangoLoginPage
This is a Login page made using Django REST Framework. The web app consists of 3 main redirection which are as follows: - 
    •	Sign Up – Where a new user can sign up themselves when they successfully create an account a success message will be shown in a form of an alert, and they will have to confirm their mail I’d with the confirmation link sent to their registered mail I’d. 
    •	Sign In – Where user can sign in post their mail confirmation. 
    •	Sign Out – Once the user clicks on the Sign out button, he will be redirected to a sign out page where he will be thanked for registering the website. 
The confirmation of mail I’d was done using token feature of python. This project coded by keeping the in mind that I would like to understand how email verifications are done and how can we use Django/Python to send mails to the user.
